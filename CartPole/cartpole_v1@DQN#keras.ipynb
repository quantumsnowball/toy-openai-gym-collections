      " |  Description:\n",
      " |      A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over by increasing and reducing the cart's velocity.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Source:\n",
      " |      This environment corresponds to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson\n",

      " |      Note: The amount the velocity that is reduced or increased is not fixed; it depends on the angle the pole is pointing. This is because the center of gravity of the pole increases the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it\n",

    "* Just like the 4x4 smaller version of this game, the 8x8 larger version has a slippery feature. If you set `is_slippery` to False, this problems will be too easily solved within seconds by using a Q-Table.\n",
    "* The source code actually add some sort of randomness to the action taken such that the action is not always predictable, thus increased the overall difficulty to train.\n",
    "* Q-Learning may still able to solve some of the case, but not sure if it can effectively learn the randomness behavior for is_slippery.\n",
    "* Can use DQN or other more advanced method to solve.\n",
    "* May be can use replay memory to let the agent learn the randomness pattern if any."
